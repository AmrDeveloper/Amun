## Introduction

Jot is an open source general purpose low level programming language with the design goal to be as simple as possible
but also as efficient as possible and give you full control written using Modern `C++` and the `LLVM` Infrastructure, one of the goals
is to be fast at compiling and runtime but also at writing new programs.


```
import "cstdio"

fun main() int64 {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Features

* Static Types
* Type inference
* Functions
* Pointers
* Arrays
* Multi Dimensional Arrays
* Strong Enumeration
* Function Pointer
* Local Variables
* Global Variables
* Import and Load statements and blocks
* If, else if and else statements
* If Else Expression
* While statement
* For range, Forever statements
* Switch Statement and Expression
* Break and continue statements with optional times
* Declare Prefix, Infix, Postfix functions
* Binary, Logical, Comparisons, Bitwise Operators
* Assignments Operatiors =, +=, -=, *=, /=
* Standard C Headers as part of the Standard library
* No implicit casting, every cast must be explicit to be clear
* Defer Statement
* Default initalization value for global and local variables
* Resolving Constants Index, If Expressions at Compile time

## Inspiration
The design of Jot is inspired by a number of languages such as `C`, `C++`, `Go`, `Rust`, `Jai`,
special thanks for every create language designer and for every open source project that share
the creativity and knowledge.
