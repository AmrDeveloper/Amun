In Amun to declare a new variable you should use the keyword `var` with optional type

```
var x = 10;
```

```
var y : int64 = 10;
```

```
var name = "Amun";
```

You can declare a variable with undefined value but in this case you explicity set type to this variable

```
var x : int64 = ---;

var ptr : *int64 = ---;
```
